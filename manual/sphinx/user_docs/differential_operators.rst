Differential operators
======================

There are a huge number of possible ways to perform differencing in
computational fluid dynamics, and BOUT++ is intended to be able to
implement a large number of them. This means that the way differentials
are handled internally is quite involved; see the developer’s manual for
full gory details. Much of the time this detail is not all that
important, and certainly not while learning to use BOUT++. Default
options are therefore set which work most of the time, so you can start
using the code without getting bogged down in these details.

In order to handle many different differencing methods and operations,
many layers are used, each of which handles just part of the problem.
The main division is between differencing methods (such as 4th-order
central differencing), and differential operators (such as
:math:`\nabla_{||}`).

.. _sec-diffmethod:

Differencing methods
--------------------

Methods are implemented on 5-point stencils, and are divided into three
categories:

-  Central-differencing methods, for diffusion operators
   :math:`\frac{df}{dx}`, :math:`\frac{d^2f}{dx^2}`. Each method has a
   short code, and currently include

   -  ``C2``: 2\ :math:`^{nd}` order :math:`f_{-1} - 2f_0 + f_1`

   -  ``C4``: 4\ :math:`^{th}` order
      :math:`(-f_{-2} + 16f_{-1} - 30f_0 + 16f_1 - f_2)/12`

   -  ``W2``: 2\ :math:`^{nd}` order CWENO

   -  ``W3``: 3\ :math:`^{rd}` order CWENO

   -  ``FFT``: Fourier Transform method in Z (axisymmetric) direction
      only

-  Upwinding methods for advection operators :math:`v_x\frac{df}{dx}`

   -  ``U1``: 1\ :math:`^{st}` order upwinding

   -  ``U4``: 4\ :math:`^{th}` order upwinding

   -  ``W3``: 3\ :math:`^{rd}` order `Weighted Essentially
      Non-Oscillatory (WENO)`_

-  Flux conserving and limiting methods for terms of the form
   :math:`\frac{d}{dx}(v_x f)`

   -  ``SPLIT``: split into upwind and central terms
      :math:`\frac{d}{dx}(v_x f) = v_x\frac{df}{dx} + f\frac{dv_x}{dx}`

   -  ``NND``: `Non-oscillatory, containing No free parameters and
      Dissipative (NND) scheme`_

.. _Weighted Essentially Non-Oscillatory (WENO): https://doi.org/10.1137/S106482759732455X

.. _Non-oscillatory, containing No free parameters and Dissipative (NND) scheme: https://doi.org/10.1088/0253-6102/54/6/28             

Both of these methods avoid overshoots (Gibbs phenomena) at sharp
gradients such as shocks, but the simple 1st-order method has very large
artificial diffusion. WENO schemes are a development of the ENO
reconstruction schemes which combine good handling of sharp-gradient
regions with high accuracy in smooth regions.

To use these differencing operators directly, add the following to the
top of your physics module::

    #include <derivs.hxx>

By default the method used will be the one specified in the options
input file (see :ref:`sec-diffmethodoptions`), but most of these
methods can take an optional `DIFF_METHOD` argument, specifying
exactly which method to use.

.. _sec-diffmethod-nonuniform:

Non-uniform meshes
------------------

**examples/test-nonuniform seems to not work?** Setting
``non_uniform = true`` in the BOUT.inp options file enables corrections
to second derivatives in :math:`X` and :math:`Y`. This correction is
given by writing derivatives as:

.. math::

   {{\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}}} \simeq \frac{1}{\Delta x} {{\frac{\partial f}{\partial i}}}

where :math:`i` is the cell index number. The second derivative is
therefore given by

.. math::

   \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^2} \simeq \frac{1}{\Delta x^2}\frac{\partial^2
   f}{\partial i^2} + \frac{1}{\Delta x}{{\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}}} \cdot
   {{\frac{\partial }{\partial i}}}(\frac{1}{\Delta x})

The correction factor :math:`\partial/\partial i(1/\Delta x)` can
be calculated automatically, but you can also specify ``d2x`` in the
grid file which is

.. math::

   \texttt{d2x} = {{\frac{\partial \Delta x}{\partial i}}} = \frac{\partial^2 x}{\partial i^2}

The correction factor is then calculated from ``d2x`` using

.. math::

   {{\frac{\partial }{\partial i}}}(\frac{1}{\Delta x}) = -\frac{1}{\Delta x^2} {{\frac{\partial \Delta x}{\partial i}}}

**Note**: There is a separate switch in the :ref:`Laplacian inversion code <sec-laplacian>`,
which enables or disables non-uniform mesh corrections.

General operators
-----------------

These are differential operators which are for a general coordinate
system.

.. math::

   \begin{array}{rclrcl}
   \mathbf{v} =& \nabla f &\qquad {\texttt{Vector}} =& {\texttt{Grad(Field)}} \\
   f =& \nabla\cdot\mathbf{a} &\qquad {\texttt{Field}} =& {\texttt{Div(Vector)}} \\
   \mathbf{v} =& \nabla\times\mathbf{a} &\qquad {\texttt{Vector}} =&
   {\texttt{Curl(Vector)}} \\
   f =& \mathbf{v}\cdot\nabla g &\qquad {\texttt{Field}} =& {\texttt{V\_dot\_Grad(Vector,
   Field)}} \\
   \mathbf{v} =& \mathbf{a}\cdot\nabla\mathbf{c} &\qquad {\texttt{Vector}} =&
   {\texttt{V\_dot\_Grad(Vector, Vector)}} \\
   f =& \nabla^2 f &\qquad {\texttt{Field}} =& {\texttt{Laplace(Field)}}
   \end{array}

.. math::

   \nabla\phi =& {{\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial u^i}}}\nabla u^i \rightarrow (\nabla\phi)_i =
       {{\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial u^i}}} \\ \nabla\cdot A =& =
       \frac{1}{J}{{\frac{\partial }{\partial u^i}}}(Jg^{ij}A_j) \\ \nabla^2\phi =&
       G^j{{\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial u^i}}} + g^{ij}\frac{\partial^2\phi}{\partial u^i\partial
       u^j}

where we have defined

.. math::

   G^j = \frac{1}{J}{{\frac{\partial }{\partial u^i}}}(Jg^{ij})

**not** to be confused with the Christoffel symbol of the second kind
(see the coordinates manual for more details).

Clebsch operators
-----------------

Another set of operators assume that the equilibrium magnetic field is
written in Clebsch form as

.. math::

   \mathbf{B}_0 = \nabla z\times\nabla x \qquad B_0 = \frac{\sqrt{g_{yy}}}{J}

where

.. math::

   \mathbf{B}_0 = |\mathbf{B}_0|\mathbf{b}_0 = B_0 \mathbf{b}_0

is the background *equilibrium* magnetic field.

.. |laplace_perp| replace:: :math:`\nabla_\perp^2 = \nabla^2 -

We have that

       \frac{1}{J\sqrt{g_{yy}}}[(g_{yy}{{\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial z}}} -
       g_{yz}{{\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial y}}}){{\frac{\partial A}{\partial x}}}
       + (g_{yz}{{\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x}}}
       - g_{xy}{{\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial z}}}){{\frac{\partial A}{\partial y}}}
       + (g_{xy}{{\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial y}}}
       - g_{yy}{{\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x}}}){{\frac{\partial A}{\partial z}}}]

.. math::

   \nabla_\perp \equiv \nabla - {{\mathbf{b}}}({{\mathbf{b}}}\cdot\nabla)

.. math::

   {{\mathbf{b}}}\cdot\nabla = \frac{1}{JB}\frac{\partial}{\partial y}

.. math::

   {{\boldsymbol{b}}} = \frac{1}{JB}{{\boldsymbol{e}}}_y = \frac{1}{JB}[g_{xy}\nabla x + g_{yy}\nabla y
   + g_{yz}\nabla z]

In a Clebsch coordinate system
:math:`{{\boldsymbol{B}}} = \nabla z \times \nabla x = \frac{1}{J}{{\boldsymbol{e}}}_y`,
:math:`g_{yy} = {{\boldsymbol{e}}}_y\cdot{{\boldsymbol{e}}}_y = J^2B^2`,
and so the :math:`\nabla y` term cancels out:

.. math::

   \nabla_\perp = \nabla x({{\frac{\partial }{\partial x}}} -
       \frac{g_{xy}}{(JB)^2}{{\frac{\partial }{\partial y}}}) + \nabla z({{\frac{\partial }{\partial z}}} -
       \frac{g_{yz}}{(JB)^2}{{\frac{\partial }{\partial y}}})

The bracket operators
---------------------

The bracket operator ``brackets(phi, f, method)`` aims to
differentiate equations on the form

.. math::

   -\frac{\nabla\phi\times{{\boldsymbol{b}}}}{B}\cdot\nabla f

Notice that when we use the Arakawa scheme, :math:`y`-derivatives are
neglected if :math:`g_{xy}` and :math:`g_{yz}` are non-zero. An
example of usage of the brackets can be found in for example
``examples/MMS/advection`` or ``examples/blob2d``.

Finite volume, conservative finite difference methods
-----------------------------------------------------

These schemes aim to conserve the integral of the advected quantity
over the domain. If :math:`f` is being advected, then

.. math::

   \sum_i \left(f J dx dy dz\right)_i = const

is conserved, where the index :math:`i` refers to cell index. This
is done by calculating fluxes between cells: Whatever leaves one
cell is added to another. There are several caveats to this:

* Boundary fluxes can still lead to changes in the total, unless
  no-flow boundary conditions are used

* When using an implicit time integration scheme, such as the default
  PVODE / CVODE, the total is not guaranteed to be conserved, but
  may vary depending on the solver tolerances.

* There will always be a small rounding error, even with double
  precision.

The methods can be used by including the header::

   #include "bout/fv_ops.hxx"


**Note** The methods are defined in a namespace ``FV``.

Some methods (those with templates) are defined in the header, but others
are defined in ``src/mesh/fv_ops.cxx``.


Parallel divergence ``Div_par``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This function calculates the divergence of a flow in :math:`y` (parallel
to the magnetic field) by a given velocity.

::

   template<typename CellEdges = MC>
   const Field3D Div_par(const Field3D &f_in, const Field3D &v_in,
                         const Field3D &a, bool fixflux=true);


where ``f_in`` is the quantity being advected (e.g. density), ``v_in``
is the parallel advection velocity. The third input, ``a``, is the maximum
wave speed, which multiplies the dissipation term in the method.

::

   ddt(n) = -FV::Div_par( n, v, cs );


By default the ``MC`` slope limiter is used to calculate cell edges, but this can
be changed at compile time e.g::

   ddt(n) = -FV::Div_par<FV::Fromm>( n, v, cs );


A list of available limiters is given in section :ref:`sec-slope-limiters` below.


Example and convergence test
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The example code ``examples/finite-volume/fluid/`` solves the Euler
equations for a 1D adiabatic fluid, using `FV::Div_par` for
the advection terms.

.. math::

   \frac{\partial n}{\partial t} + \nabla_{||}\left(n v_{||}\right) = 0

   \frac{\partial p}{\partial t} + \nabla_{||}\left(p v_{||}\right) = -(\gamma-1) p \nabla_{||}v_{||}

   \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(nv_{||}\right) + \nabla_{||}\left(nv_{||}v_{||}\right) = -\partial_{||} p

where :math:`n` is the density, :math:`p` is the pressure, and
:math:`nv_{||}` is the momentum in the direction parallel to the
magnetic field.  The operator :math:`\nabla_{||}` represents the
divergence of a parallel flow (``Div_par``), and :math:`\partial_{||}
= \mathbf{b}\cdot\nabla` is the gradient in the parallel direction.

There is a convergence test using the Method of Manufactured Solutions (MMS) for this example.
See section :ref:`sec-mms` for details of the testing method. Running the ``runtest``
script should produce the graph

.. figure:: ../figs/fluid_norm_mc.png
   :name: fluid_norm_mc
   :alt: Convergence test of the fluid example using `FV::Div_par` operator

   Convergence test, showing :math:`l^2` (RMS) and :math:`l^{\infty}` (maximum) error for
   the evolving fields `n` (density), `p` (pressure) and `nv` (momentum). All fields are
   shown to converge at the expected second order accuracy.



Parallel diffusion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The parallel diffusion operator calculates :math:`\nabla_{||}\left[k\partial_||\left(f\right)\right]`

::

   const Field3D Div_par_K_Grad_par(const Field3D &k, const Field3D &f,
                                    bool bndry_flux=true);


This is done by calculating the flux :math:`k\partial_||\left(f\right)` on cell boundaries
using central differencing.


Advection in 3D
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This operator calculates :math:`\nabla\cdot\left( n \mathbf{v} \right)` where
:math:`\mathbf{v}` is a 3D vector. It is written in flux form by discretising the expression

.. math::

   \nabla\cdot\left( \mathbf{A} \right) = \frac{1}{J}\partial_i \left(J A^i\right)

Like the ``Div_par`` operator, a slope limiter is used to calculate the value of
the field :math:`n` on cell boundaries. By default this is the MC method, but
this can be set as a template parameter.

::

   template<typename CellEdges = MC>
   const Field3D Div_f_v(const Field3D &n, const Vector3D &v, bool bndry_flux)




.. _sec-slope-limiters:

Slope limiters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here limiters are implemented as slope limiters: The value of a given
quantity is calculated at the faces of a cell based on the cell-centre
values. Several slope limiters are defined in ``fv_ops.hxx``:

* ``Upwind`` - First order upwinding, in which the left and right edges
  of the cell are the same as the centre (zero slope).

* ``Fromm`` - A second-order scheme which is a fixed weighted average
  of upwinding and central difference schemes.

* ``MinMod`` - This second order scheme switches between the upwind and
  downwind gradient, choosing the one with the smallest absolute value.
  If the gradients have different signs, as at a maximum or minimum,
  then the method reverts to first order upwinding (zero slope).

* ``MC`` (Monotonised Central) is a second order scheme which switches
  between central, upwind and downwind differencing in a similar way
  to ``MinMod``. It has smaller dissipation than ``MinMod`` so is the
  default.


.. _sec-derivatives:

Derivative internals
--------------------

This is probably the part of the code most people will want to alter,
and is in ``bout++/src/sys/derivs.cxx``. The main task of this module is
to map functions on fields like ``DDX`` to direction-independent
differential methods on stencils such as :math:`4^{th}`-order central
differencing. This mapping depends on global settings in ``BOUT.inp``
and is illustrated in :numref:`fig-diffOverview`.

.. _fig-diffOverview:
.. figure:: ../figs/diffOverview.*
   :alt: Overview of ``derivs`` module

   Overview of ``derivs`` module, mapping derivative functions on fields
   to direction-independent differential methods

Four kinds of differencing methods are supported

#. | First derivative ``DDX``, ``DDY``, ``DDZ``
   | Central differencing type schemes for first-order derivatives

#. | Second derivatives ``D2DX2``, ``D2DZ2``, ``D2DZ2``
   | Central differencing second derivatives e.g. for :math:`\nabla^2`

#. | Upwinding ``VDDX``, ``VDDY``, ``VDDZ``
   | Terms like :math:`\mathbf{v}\cdot\nabla`

#. | Flux methods ``FDDX``, ``FDDY``, ``FDDZ``
   | Flux conserving, limiting methods for terms like
     :math:`\nabla\cdot\left(\mathbf{v}f\right)`

The differencing methods themselves are independent on direction, and
have types defined in :doc:`derivs.cxx<../_breathe_autogen/file/derivs_8cxx>`

::

    typedef BoutReal (*deriv_func)(stencil &); // f
    typedef BoutReal (*upwind_func)(stencil &, stencil &); // v, f

These operate on ``stencil`` objects. This class is in :doc:`stencils.hxx<../_breathe_autogen/file/stencils_8hxx>`

::

    class stencil {
      public:
        int jx, jy, jz;  // Central location
        BoutReal c, p, m, pp, mm; // stencil 2 each side of the centre
        Overloaded operators
          =,+,-,*,/
        Functions
          min, max, abs
    };

The main purpose of this class is to store a 5-element stencil. To
simplify some code this class also has a bunch of overloaded operators
on BoutReals and other stencil objects. There are also some functions to
calculate things like absolute, minimum, and maximum values.

Lookup tables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To convert between short variable names (“C2”), long descriptions
(“2nd order Central Differencing”), ``DIFF_METHOD`` enums used to
specify methods at runtime (DIFF\_C2, defined in
:doc:`bout_types.hxx<../_breathe_autogen/file/bout__types_8hxx>`), and
function pointers (``DDX_C2``), taking into account whether variables
are shifted or not, BOUT++ uses a set of lookup tables.

To find function pointers, tables of the following type are used::

    /// Translate between DIFF_METHOD codes, and functions
    struct DiffLookup {
      DIFF_METHOD method;
      deriv_func func;     // Single-argument differencing function
      upwind_func up_func; // Upwinding function
    };

Because the ``DiffLookup`` type contains a ``deriv_func`` and
``upwind_func`` pointer, it is used for all function lookup tables.
There is a separate table for each type of differencing method, so for
example the table of non-staggered upwinding methods is

::

    /// Upwinding functions lookup table
    static DiffLookup UpwindTable[] = { {DIFF_U1, NULL, VDDX_U1},
                        {DIFF_C2, NULL, VDDX_C2},
                        {DIFF_U4, NULL, VDDX_U4},
                        {DIFF_W3, NULL, VDDX_WENO3},
                        {DIFF_C4, NULL, VDDX_C4},
                        {DIFF_DEFAULT}};

The ``DIFF_DEFAULT`` at the end is used to terminate the array. These
tables are used by functions

::

    deriv_func lookupFunc(DiffLookup* table, DIFF_METHOD method);
    upwind_func lookupUpwindFunc(DiffLookup* table, DIFF_METHOD method);

which return the function pointer corresponding to the given method. If
the method isn’t in the table, then the first entry in the table is
used. These functions can be used at run-time to allow a user to specify
the method to use for specific operators.

When reading settings from the input file, they are specified as short
strings like “C2”, and a longer description of the method chosen should
be written to the output log. To do this, there is a name lookup table::

    /// Translate between short names, long names and DIFF_METHOD codes
    struct DiffNameLookup {
      DIFF_METHOD method;
      const char* label; // Short name
      const char* name;  // Long name
    };

    static DiffNameLookup DiffNameTable[] = {
      {DIFF_U1, "U1", "First order upwinding"},
      {DIFF_C2, "C2", "Second order central"},
      {DIFF_W2, "W2", "Second order WENO"},
      {DIFF_W3, "W3", "Third order WENO"},
      {DIFF_C4, "C4", "Fourth order central"},
      {DIFF_U4, "U4", "Fourth order upwinding"},
      {DIFF_FFT, "FFT", "FFT"},
      {DIFF_DEFAULT}}; // Use to terminate the list

To search this table, there is the function

::

    DIFF_METHOD lookupFunc(DiffLookup *table, const string &label)

During initialisation, the lookup therefore works in two stages, shown
in :numref:`fig-diffLookup`. First the short description is turned into a
``DIFF_METHOD`` enum code, then this code is turned into a function
pointer.

Staggered grids
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, all quantities in BOUT++ are defined at cell centre, and all
derivative methods map cell-centred quantities to cell centres.
Switching on staggered grid support in BOUT.inp::

    StaggerGrids = true

allows quantities to be defined on cell boundaries. Functions such as
``DDX`` now have to handle all possible combinations of input and output
locations, in addition to the possible derivative methods.

Several things are not currently implemented, which probably should be:

-  Only 3D fields currently have a cell location attribute. The location
   (cell centre etc) of 2D fields is ignored at the moment. The
   rationale for this is that 2D fields are assumed to be slowly-varying
   equilibrium quantities for which it won’t matter so much. Still,
   needs to be improved in future

-  Twist-shift and X shifting still treat all quantities as
   cell-centred.

-  No boundary condition functions yet account for cell location.

Currently, BOUT++ does not support values at cell corners; values can
only be defined at cell centre, or at the lower X,Y, or Z boundaries.
This is

Once staggered grids are enabled, two types of stencil are needed: those
which map between the same cell location (e.g. cell-centred values to
cell-centred values), and those which map to different locations (e.g.
cell-centred to lower X).

Derivatives of the Fourier transform
------------------------------------

By using the definition of the Fourier transformed, we have

.. math::

   F(x,y,\xi) = {\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} {f(x,y,z)\exp(-2\pi iz\xi)} \; \text{d} {z}}

this gives

.. math::
   :label: f_derivative

   &{\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} {(\partial_zf[x,y,z])\exp(-2\pi iz\xi)} \; \text{d} {z}}\\
   =& {\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} {\partial_z(f[x,y,z]\exp[-2\pi iz\xi])} \; \text{d} {z}}
   - {\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} {f(x,y,z)\partial_z\exp(-2\pi iz\xi)} \; \text{d} {z}}\\
   =& (f[x,y,z]\exp[-2\pi iz\xi])\bigg|_{-\infty}^{\infty} - (-2\pi
   i\xi){\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} {f(x,y,z)\exp(-2\pi iz\xi)} \; \text{d} {z}}\\
   =& 2\pi i\xi F(x,y,\xi)

where we have used that :math:`f(x,y,\pm\infty)=0` in order to have a
well defined Fourier transform. This means that

.. math::

   \partial_z^n F(x,y,\xi) = (2\pi i \xi)^n F(x,y,\xi)

In our case, we are dealing with periodic boundary conditions. Strictly
speaking, the Fourier transform does not exist in such cases, but it is
possible to define a Fourier transform in the limit which in the end
lead to the Fourier series [1]_ By discretising the spatial domain, it
is no longer possible to represent the infinite amount of Fourier modes,
but only :math:`N+1` number of modes, where :math:`N` is the number of
points (this includes the modes with negative frequencies, and the
zeroth offset mode). For the discrete Fourier transform, we have

.. math::
   :label: DFT

   F(x,y)_{k} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{Z=0}^{N-1}f(x,y)_{Z}\exp(\frac{-2\pi i k Z}{N})

where :math:`k` is the mode number, :math:`N` is the number of points
in :math:`z`. If we call the sampling points of :math:`z` for
:math:`z_Z`, where :math:`Z = 0, 1 \ldots N-1`, we have that
:math:`z_Z = Z \text{d}z`. As our domain goes from :math:`[0, 2\pi[`,
we have that (since we have one less line segment than point)
:math:`\text{d}z (N-1) = L_z = 2\pi - \text{d}z`, which gives
:math:`\text{d}z = \frac{2\pi}{N}`.  Inserting this is equation
(:eq:`DFT`) yields

.. math::

   F(x,y)_{k} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{Z=0}^{N-1}f(x,y)_{Z}\exp( - i k
   Z\text{d}z) = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{Z=0}^{N-1}f(x,y)_{Z}\exp( - i k z_Z)

The discrete version of equation (:eq:`f_derivative`) thus gives

.. math::

   \partial_z^n F(x,y)_k = (i k)^n F(x,y)_k
